# Turning Segmented Display Designs from youtuber Posy into Real e-ink like Displays
I have turned segmented displays designs from youtuber Posy into real displays - and not just any displays, but displays that are thin, flexible, and act like the e-ink, meaning you can disconnect them from the power, and they will still show the content for a few minutes. 
The displays were manufactured by company Ynvisible, and IÂ´m using Arduino UNO R4 with the DAC (digital to analog converter) capability to drive those displays without any in-between driver board. This is because those displays require voltage of around 1.5V, and Arduino boards often times work with either 3.3V or 5V.
